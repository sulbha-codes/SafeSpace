      Empower yourself with these smart safety practices.  
      Awareness is your superpower.
    </p>

    <ul class="tips-list">
      <li>🔒 Always share your live location with a trusted friend when traveling alone at night.</li>
      <li>📱 Keep emergency numbers saved and easily accessible.</li>
      <li>🚶‍♀️ Walk confidently and trust your instincts — if something feels off, leave.</li>
      <li>🧠 Be aware of your surroundings. Avoid distractions like texting while walking alone.</li>
      <li>👥 Use public transportation with visible security. Sit near other women or families.</li>
      <li>🚖 Before getting into a cab, verify the number plate and driver's name.</li>
      <li>🧳 Always carry a power bank. A dead phone is not an option in emergencies.</li>

      <h3>Remember This 💜</h3>
      <p>
        A woman’s strength is not in being fearless —  
        it’s in choosing to rise, again and again, even in fear.  
        You are not alone. Your safety matters. Your voice matters.
